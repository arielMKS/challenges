# Challenges
This repository contains some coding exercises that will help to develop your skills as a Javascript developer. Each folder will contain a single challenge. Your goal is to solve the challenge and push a branch which contains your solution. 

# Recommendations
Although there are a lot of git GUI tools out there, I recommend using the git command line. It is an essential tool to be familiar with as you will not always have your GUI tool available to you!
